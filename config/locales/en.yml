    about_text: "RISE Project—Research Infrastructure for the Study of Eurasia—is a digital research infrastructure developed by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. It is a pioneering approach for resource dissemination and emerging data analytics in the humanities. Its various technical components facilitate the secure linkage between third-party research tools to various third-party textual collections (both licensed and open-access ones) via a standard set of APIs called %{shine_path: SHINE}."
    for_researchers_text: "Gain unprecedented access to textual resources in a machine-readable format, so that they can be analyzed in research tools in a seamless and legal research workflow! Please %{sign_up:sign up} and visit the %{resources_page:RISE Catalog} to view the resources you have access to based on your affiliation."
    for_research_tool_developers_text: "Connect easily to resource repositories and make data import painless for your users!"
    for_resource_providers_text: "Reach more users, connect easily to research tools and facilitate resource exchange securely!"
    standard_rp_text: "Implement %{shine_path: SHINE-compatible API endpoints} to manage access to your resources and to make them available via the ."
    hosted_rp_text: "Use the %{toolkits_path: RISE-RP Toolkit} to host and publish the resources that you want to share via %{doc_path: SHINE}."
    rp_bottom_text: "Contact our team to get started"
    standard_rtd_text: "Implement %{doc_path: SHINE-compatible API endpoints} to securely consume resources available via the %{catalog_path: RISE Catalog}."
    hosted_rtd_text: "Use the %{toolkits_path: RISE-CM Toolkit} to allow users to browse and import SHINE-compatible resources directly in your tool's user interface."
    rtd_bottom_text: 
  api_help_text: Use the interface below to interact with the SHINE API. Use your RISE-API-TOKEN to authenticate your interactions. Your individual RISE-API-TOKEN will appear below once you have logged in.
  resource_provider_help_text: SHINE's standard API mapper requires resource providers to implement a minimal set of API endpoints to make their resources available. Resources are protected by the RISE-API-TOKEN authorization header. This token mechanism allows resource providers to limit and monitor access to their resources.
  researcher_help_text: Rise gives your favourite research tools access to both open-access resources such as Kanripo and more private ones, usually made accessible to you through your research institution/affiliation.

  slogan: Standard for secure resource exchange and interoperability
  about_content:
    text_1: "%{shine_path: SHINE} is a set of standardized application programming interfaces (API) for exchanging textual resources, both open-access ones and protected (or licensed) ones that require authentication and authorization. Resource providers and research tool developers will find %{shine_path: SHINE} useful because it supports interoperability among resource repositories and research tools in a decentralized manner. Researchers will find %{shine_path: SHINE} useful because they will gain unprecedented access to textual resources in a machine-readable format, so that textual resources can be analyzed in research tools in a seamless and legal research workflow."
    text_2: "RISE is a middleware that protects resource exchanges via %{shine_path: SHINE}. It authenticates and authorizes these exchanges, especially for protected (or licensed) resources. It also includes a browser-based administrative interface for resource providers, research tool developers, and research organizations to regulate protocols for specific resource exchanges. To access RISE, please %{sign_up: sign up here}."
    text_3: "To demonstrate the benefits of adopting RISE and/or %{shine_path: SHINE} and to encourage third-party development of SHINE-compatible technical solutions, %{toolkits_path: a suite of open-resource softwares linked to RISE} are available for others to adopt and adapt for their own purposes."
    text_4: "The RISE Project is developed by the %{max_planck_path: Max Planck Institute for the History of Science}, with the support of %{sbb_path: Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin}. To see all the project collaborators and learn how you can get involved, please visit %{community_path: this link}."
